## Nota

As part of this project, we had to submit several deliverables in different forms (notebook, report & README). We chose to submit a notebook summarizing only the pipeline used to achieve our best prediction score. Thus, the different phases of exploratory analysis, models tested and hyperparameter tuning will be mentioned in the report. We think it's better and easier to have such a notebook: you will use it to generate the prediction file without wasting a lot of time during the hyperparameter search phase, for example.


## Instructions

The notebook submitted to Gradescope has been designed to be directly run in Kaggle. Thereby, neither modification nor further instruction is required to run the code.
